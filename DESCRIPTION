Description: Google's Compact Language Detector 3 is a neural network model for language 
    identification (see <https://github.com/google/cld3#readme> for more information). This
    version is not merely an update for the 'cld2' library (also available from CRAN) but 
    rather a novell approach to language detection with different properties and outcomes.
